# Resume
My most up to date [resume](zach_wieand_resume.pdf) using LaTeX. While this
repository will generate a one page resume, it will include my entire work
history as well as the git history as I make updates.

### Getting Started
I recommend installing [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) for
viewing and editing LaTeX.

Once satisfied with the output in TexMaker. I recommend using the following
command for generating the final output PDF.
```bash
xelatex zach_wieand_resume.tex
```

This will generate the output pdf `zach_wieand_resume.pdf` which should be
commited to this repository.
